## Key Design Decisions Made

### 1. Variable Game Length Formula
**Decision:** `(Attack Cards × 2) + 1` as default
**Rationale:** Simple for beginners, realistic for attack progression, scalable
**Alternatives Considered:** d10+5, d20 bands, manual selection
**Outcome:** Two-track system (default + advanced) accommodates all player types

### 2. Forensics Module Placement
**Decision:** 5th module in sequence, between Disaster Recovery and Audit
**Rationale:** Investigation comes after breach discovery/crisis response
**Outcome:** Feeds findings into Hardening and Audit modules
**Alternative:** Could be sequential or standalone (both supported)

### 3. Card Layout Variation
**Decision:** Document current variation in OPTION C framework
**Rationale:** Organic design emerges naturally; defer standardization decision
**Outcome:** Post-playtesting, choose standardize (A/B) or keep variation (C)
**Note:** Listed as Item #7 in FUTURE_WORK for deliberate decision

### 4. Rule Consistency Approach
**Decision:** Document all modules; audit for consistency; defer breaking changes
**Rationale:** v2.1 MVP priority is completeness, not perfection
**Outcome:** Item #6 in FUTURE_WORK with detailed audit framework
**Timeline:** Post-playtesting, iterate on any inconsistencies

### 5. Three Critical Rules for Game Integrity
**Decision:** Explicit rules prevent metagaming while maintaining learning value
**Rationale:**
- Rule 1 (accept rolls): Prevents "fudging" results
- Rule 2 (no tier deduction): Prevents pattern recognition
- Rule 3 (rare modifiers): Prevents arbitrary adjustments
**Outcome:** System maintains educational integrity while embracing realism

   - Run one full game (60-90 min)
   - Collect feedback using provided rubric

### SHORT-TERM (Next 2-4 Weeks)
2. **Complete 5+ playtests minimum**
   - Various player types
   - Different module combinations
   - Track timing, engagement, rule clarity

3. **Analyze playtest data**
   - Average session duration vs. expected
   - Rule confusion points
   - Card balance issues
   - Variable game length formula validation

### MEDIUM-TERM (After Playtesting)
4. **Rule Consistency Audit** (Item #6)
   - Identifies gaps and inconsistencies
   - Establishes design patterns
   - High-impact, medium effort

5. **Card Balance Validation** (Item #2)
   - Identify overpowered/underpowered cards
   - Adjust costs/DCs as needed
   - Test iterations

6. **Database Migration** (Item #4)
   - Only after validation
   - Enables future scaling
   - Automates card management

## Key Metrics to Track

**During Playtesting (Collect with Rubric):**
- Session duration vs. expected (from formula)
- Turn count appropriateness (too rushed/loose?)
- Budget constraint effectiveness
- Rule clarity (what needed explanation?)
- Card balance (overpowered/useless cards?)
- Engagement level (fun factor, learning)
- Variable game length system feedback

**Post-Playtesting (Analyze):**
- Win rate by module (target ~40-60%)
- Card usage frequency (which cards get picked?)
- Rule consistency issues (conflicts between modules?)
- Timing accuracy (does formula predict well?)
- Player comprehension (what's confusing?)

## The Complete Cybersecurity Lifecycle

Incident Zero now covers the **complete incident response lifecycle**:

```
PLAN         → BUILD           → TEST         → ATTACK
Network      → Hardening       → Incident      → (Attacker succeeds)
Building       (Proactive)       Response       or
             (Defense)         (Detection)     (Detected)
                                   ↓
                            RESPOND → INVESTIGATE
                            Disaster Recovery → Forensics
                            (Crisis Mgmt)      (Analysis & Attribution)
                                   ↓
                            IMPROVE
                            Audit & Compliance
                            (Assessment & Controls)
```

**Coverage: ~95% of real incident response**

## Design Philosophy Established

**Two Key Principles for Incident Zero:**

1. **Simple Default + Complex Depth**
   - Beginners use Default Formula: just one calculation
   - Advanced players use Tier System: sophisticated control + variation
   - Both systems coexist, neither mandatory

2. **Realism Through Randomness**
   - Variable game lengths reflect real-world unpredictability
   - Tight timelines (attackers faster) and loose timelines (attackers methodical) both realistic
   - Critical Rules prevent gaming the system while preserving chaos

3. **Educational Through Evidence Discovery**
   - Sophistication hidden, revealed through gameplay
   - Players learn attack types by analyzing evidence
   - Prevents metagaming ("we know it's TIER 2 because...")

---

## Community Readiness

The game is ready to share with:
- ✅ Security educators (full rules, standalone guides, lesson plans)
- ✅ Board game designers (complete system, balance data framework)
- ✅ Incident responders (teaching material with realism notes)
- ✅ GitHub community (open-source, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)
