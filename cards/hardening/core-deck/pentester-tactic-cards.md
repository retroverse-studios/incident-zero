# Hardening Module: Pentester Tactic Cards

**Version:** 2.1 - Balanced & Refined Edition
**Last Updated:** October 2025

---

## Overview

**Pentester Tactic Cards** are unique to the Hardening Module. These 8 cards represent real-world red team attack tactics that challenge the defenses the Blue Team has deployed.

- **Total Cards:** 8 (PT-01 to PT-08)
- **Used In:** Hardening module only
- **Purpose:** Challenge deployed defenses and test defense resilience
- **Timing:** Drawn during mid-game "Pentester Challenge" (typically turns 3-4)

---

## Core Concept

During the Hardening module gameplay:

1. **Blue Team Deploys Defenses** - Accumulate defensive controls across 5-7 turns
2. **Pentester Challenge Occurs** - Red team launches simulated attack
3. **Defense Test** - Deployed defenses are tested against the tactic
4. **Resolution** - Blue Team rolls d20 + modifiers to see if defense holds
5. **Learning Moment** - Whether attack succeeds or fails, discuss why

## Pentester Tactic Cards

### PT-01: Social Engineering - Pretexting Attack
**Tactic Type:** Initial Access / Social Engineering
**Target Vectors:** SOCIAL_ENGINEERING, CREDENTIAL_ABUSE
**Difficulty:** BASIC (defeat DC 12)

**Description:**
A pentester calls your IT helpdesk impersonating a VIP executive. They claim to be traveling without their laptop and need emergency access to critical systems. They pressure the helpdesk with urgency and authority. Can they bypass your security procedures?

**Attack Details:**
- Targets: User security training gaps, process enforcement
- Success indicates: Social engineering protocols aren't followed
- Blue Team rolls 1d20 to resist

**Defending Defenses:**
- **D-02 (User Security Training):** +2 bonus (staff trained to verify callers)
- **D-07 (MFA):** +1 bonus (second factor still required)
- **D-23 (Incident Response Playbooks):** +2 bonus (clear escalation procedures)

**Outcome:**
- **Blue Team Succeeds (11+):** Helpdesk follows proper verification procedures, attacker is denied
- **Blue Team Fails:** Attacker gains credentials or system access; Blue Team must deploy additional defenses

**Teaching Point:** Social engineering exploits human psychology and organizational process gaps. Technology alone cannot defend against this; training and procedures are essential.

### PT-02: Malware Evasion - Living-off-the-Land Technique
**Tactic Type:** Persistence & Execution
**Target Vectors:** MALWARE, CREDENTIAL_ABUSE
**Difficulty:** INTERMEDIATE (defeat DC 13)

**Description:**
A pentester delivers a payload that uses only built-in Windows tools (PowerShell, scheduled tasks, registry modifications, WMI) to maintain persistence and establish a beachhead. No suspicious files, no external C2 traffic—just legitimate Windows features weaponized. Can your defenses detect this?

**Attack Details:**
- Targets: Traditional antivirus, signature-based detection
- Success indicates: Blind spot in malware detection strategy
- Blue Team rolls 1d20 to detect and block

**Defending Defenses:**
- **D-06 (Basic Antivirus):** +1 bonus only (signatures don't catch living-off-the-land)
- **D-08 (EDR):** +3 bonus (behavioral detection catches anomalous PowerShell/schtasks)
- **D-13 (Threat Hunting):** +2 bonus (proactive hunting finds MITRE ATT&CK techniques)
- **D-14 (Memory Forensics):** +2 bonus (finds injected code in memory)

**Outcome:**
- **Blue Team Succeeds (12+):** EDR or threat hunting detects the attack before persistence is established
- **Blue Team Fails:** Attacker establishes persistent access; Blue Team must escalate incident response

**Teaching Point:** Signature-based defenses are insufficient against sophisticated attackers. Behavioral detection and proactive hunting are essential for modern threats.

### PT-03: Credential Dumping - Mimikatz Attack
**Tactic Type:** Privilege Escalation / Credential Access
**Target Vectors:** CREDENTIAL_ABUSE, MALWARE
**Difficulty:** INTERMEDIATE (defeat DC 13)

**Description:**
A pentester with local admin privileges attempts to dump LSASS memory and extract cached domain credentials using Mimikatz. These credentials could then be used for lateral movement and privilege escalation. Can your endpoint defenses prevent this?

**Attack Details:**
- Targets: LSASS memory protection, credential storage hardening
- Success indicates: Weak credential protection on endpoints
- Blue Team rolls 1d20 to block the attack

**Defending Defenses:**
- **D-07 (MFA):** +1 bonus only (doesn't protect cached credentials)
- **D-12 (Password Vault):** +2 bonus (service accounts in vault aren't in LSASS)
- **D-14 (Memory Forensics):** +2 bonus (detects LSASS tampering)
- **D-16 (Credential Guard & Secure Boot):** +4 bonus (isolates LSASS in virtualized container—primary defense)
- **D-08 (EDR):** +2 bonus (alerts on suspicious LSASS access)

**Outcome:**
- **Blue Team Succeeds (12+):** Credential Guard blocks the attack or EDR detects the attempt
- **Blue Team Fails:** Domain credentials compromised; Blue Team loses future rolls vs. credential-based attacks (-1 penalty for remaining game)

**Teaching Point:** Privileged credential protection is critical. Credential Guard is the gold standard for endpoint protection. Service account password rotation and vaults prevent cached credential abuse.

### PT-04: Lateral Movement - Network Traversal
**Tactic Type:** Lateral Movement
**Target Vectors:** NETWORK, CREDENTIAL_ABUSE
**Difficulty:** INTERMEDIATE (defeat DC 13)

**Description:**
A pentester with access to one workstation attempts to move laterally across your network using SMB share enumeration, pass-the-hash attacks, and exploitation of unsecured share access. Can your network architecture and controls prevent this?

**Attack Details:**
- Targets: Network segmentation, share access controls
- Success indicates: Flat network with unrestricted SMB traffic
- Blue Team rolls 1d20 + architecture modifiers

**Defending Defenses:**
- **D-04 (Firewall Rules):** +1 bonus (blocks some traffic, but not SMB on internal network)
- **D-09 (Network Segmentation):** +3 bonus (restricts SMB traffic between segments)
- **D-10 (SIEM Correlation):** +2 bonus (detects lateral movement patterns)
- **D-15 (Honeypots):** +2 bonus (attacker triggers canary token)
- **D-20 (Zero Trust Access):** +3 bonus (even lateral access requires authentication)

**Outcome:**
- **Blue Team Succeeds (12+):** Network segmentation or honeypots stop the attack
- **Blue Team Fails:** Attacker establishes foothold on file server or domain controller; future defense deployments cost 1.5x Budget

**Teaching Point:** Flat networks are indefensible. Network segmentation combined with zero-trust access controls are essential. Honeypots are low-cost but highly effective deterrents.

### PT-05: Privilege Escalation - Unpatched Kernel Exploit
**Tactic Type:** Privilege Escalation
**Target Vectors:** MALWARE, WEB_EXPLOIT
**Difficulty:** ADVANCED (defeat DC 14)

**Description:**
A pentester discovers an unpatched vulnerability in a critical Windows kernel or third-party driver. They develop a local privilege escalation exploit that elevates from user to SYSTEM privileges. Can your patch management and detection systems catch this?

**Attack Details:**
- Targets: Patch management gaps, detection of privilege escalation
- Success indicates: Unpatched systems or poor vulnerability management
- Blue Team rolls 1d20 to patch or detect

**Defending Defenses:**
- **D-03 (Windows Patching):** +3 bonus (prevents the vulnerability from existing)
- **D-05 (Log Centralization):** +1 bonus (may detect unusual privilege elevation attempts)
- **D-08 (EDR):** +3 bonus (behavioral detection alerts on privilege escalation)
- **D-13 (Threat Hunting):** +2 bonus (proactive hunting finds unpatched systems)

**Outcome:**
- **Blue Team Succeeds (13+):** Patch management or EDR prevents or detects the exploit before escalation
- **Blue Team Fails:** Attacker gains system-level access; all subsequent attacks get +1 bonus, all defensive deployments get -1 penalty for remainder of game

**Teaching Point:** Patch management is one of the highest-ROI security controls. Unpatched systems are low-hanging fruit for attackers. Automated patching and vulnerability scanning are essential.

### PT-06: Data Exfiltration - Unmonitored Channel
**Tactic Type:** Exfiltration
**Target Vectors:** DATA_EXFIL, NETWORK
**Difficulty:** ADVANCED (defeat DC 14)

**Description:**
A pentester with network access attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data (customer database, source code, trade secrets) via an unmonitored channel: DNS tunneling, steganography in image uploads, or a rogue cloud storage account. Can your DLP and monitoring systems catch this?

**Attack Details:**
- Targets: Data loss prevention, network monitoring blind spots
- Success indicates: Unsupervised data channels or weak DLP enforcement
- Blue Team rolls 1d20 to detect and block

**Defending Defenses:**
- **D-04 (Firewall Rules):** +1 bonus (may block some exfil channels)
- **D-05 (Log Centralization):** +1 bonus (may reveal unusual network traffic)
- **D-10 (SIEM Correlation):** +2 bonus (detects anomalous data transfer patterns)
- **D-11 (DLP):** +4 bonus (primary defense against data exfil)
- **D-22 (SIEM):** +2 bonus (detects data access and transfer anomalies)
- **D-24 (Threat Intelligence):** +1 bonus (identifies known C2 domains/IPs)

**Outcome:**
- **Blue Team Succeeds (13+):** DLP or network monitoring detects and blocks the exfil attempt
- **Blue Team Fails:** Data is exfiltrated; Blue Team immediately loses the game (breach is complete)

**Teaching Point:** DLP and network monitoring are essential for preventing data loss. Organizations must understand their critical data flows and monitor them accordingly.

### PT-07: Supply Chain Compromise - Trusted Software Update
**Tactic Type:** Initial Access / Persistence
**Target Vectors:** MALWARE, WEB_EXPLOIT
**Difficulty:** ADVANCED (defeat DC 14)

**Description:**
A pentester compromises a software vendor that your organization trusts. They inject malicious code into a legitimate update that your organization automatically deploys. The malware is signed with the vendor's legitimate certificate. Can you detect and prevent this?

**Attack Details:**
- Targets: Update management, supply chain security, behavioral detection
- Success indicates: Over-trust in vendor updates, poor verification procedures
- Blue Team rolls 1d20 to detect or prevent

**Defending Defenses:**
- **D-03 (Windows Patching):** +0 bonus (legitimate patch—can't be distinguished)
- **D-06 (Antivirus):** +1 bonus only (legitimate signature—won't help)
- **D-08 (EDR):** +3 bonus (behavioral detection catches malicious activity after installation)
- **D-13 (Threat Hunting):** +2 bonus (proactive hunting for suspicious post-update behavior)
- **D-17 (Malware Sandbox):** +2 bonus (detonates update before deployment)
- **D-21 (Container Security):** +2 bonus (prevents compromise spread in containerized environments)

**Outcome:**
- **Blue Team Succeeds (13+):** EDR or threat hunting detects malicious behavior before widespread compromise
- **Blue Team Fails:** Supply chain compromise spreads across organization; -2 penalty to all defense rolls for remainder of game

**Teaching Point:** Trust is not security. Even legitimate vendors can be compromised. Behavioral detection, code signing verification, and staged rollouts are essential.

### PT-08: Insider Threat - Malicious Administrator
**Tactic Type:** Privilege Abuse / Data Exfiltration
**Target Vectors:** CREDENTIAL_ABUSE, DATA_EXFIL, NETWORK
**Difficulty:** EXPERT (defeat DC 15)

**Description:**
A pentester acts as a disgruntled administrator with legitimate system access. They use their privileges to bypass security controls, disable logging, create backdoor accounts, and exfiltrate sensitive data. Can your controls prevent insider threats?

**Attack Details:**
- Targets: Administrative account monitoring, privilege abuse detection
- Success indicates: Weak monitoring of privileged access, overly broad admin permissions
- Blue Team rolls 1d20 to detect and prevent

**Defending Defenses:**
- **D-05 (Log Centralization):** +2 bonus (immutable offsite logs prevent tampering)
- **D-07 (MFA):** +1 bonus (makes it harder to create backdoor accounts)
- **D-10 (SIEM Correlation):** +2 bonus (detects unusual admin activity patterns)
- **D-12 (Password Vault):** +2 bonus (requires approval/audit for privileged access)
- **D-20 (Zero Trust Access):** +3 bonus (even admins require proper authorization for sensitive access)
- **D-22 (SIEM):** +3 bonus (behavioral analytics detect insider threats)
- **D-23 (Incident Response Playbooks):** +1 bonus (clear escalation for suspicious admin activity)

**Outcome:**
- **Blue Team Succeeds (14+):** Monitoring detects unauthorized admin activity before damage
- **Blue Team Fails:** Insider exfiltrates data and disables controls; Blue Team loses game immediately and additional penalties apply to Disaster Recovery module (if played next)

**Teaching Point:** Insider threats are one of the hardest problems in security. Prevention is impossible; detection is essential. Privileged access management, behavioral monitoring, and immutable audit logs are critical.

## How Pentester Tactics Are Used in Gameplay

### Timing
Pentester Tactics are typically drawn during turns 3-4 of the 5-7 turn game. This gives the Blue Team time to deploy initial defenses but creates time pressure for the final deployment phase.

### Resolution
When a Pentester Tactic is drawn:

1. **Announce the Attack:** Read the tactic description to the Blue Team
2. **Blue Team Prepares:** They can use remaining turn action to deploy additional defense or pass
3. **Roll Initiative:** Blue Team rolls 1d20
4. **Add Modifiers:**
   - +2 for each ELITE defense countering this vector
   - +1 for each ADVANCED defense countering this vector
   - +1 for relevant defensive architecture (e.g., +1 for segmented network vs. lateral movement)
5. **Compare to DC:** If total ≥ DC, tactic fails; if < DC, tactic succeeds
6. **Apply Consequences:** Based on success or failure

### Stacking Defense Bonuses
Multiple defenses can combine against a single tactic:
- All relevant defenses provide their bonuses to the same roll
- Example: PT-03 (Credential Dumping) faces both D-16 (+4) and D-08 (+2) = +6 total bonus

### Difficulty Progression
- PT-01, PT-02, PT-04: Early tactics (easier to defeat)
- PT-03, PT-05, PT-06, PT-07: Mid-game tactics (harder, require multiple defenses)
- PT-08: Final challenge (hardest, requires comprehensive defense-in-depth)

---

## Design Philosophy

**Each Pentester Tactic represents a real-world attack pattern** that:
1. **Is realistic** - Based on actual TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) from MITRE ATT&CK
2. **Teaches defense priorities** - Success requires defense-in-depth, not single solutions
3. **Demonstrates gaps** - Failing a tactic shows where the defense strategy is weak
4. **Encourages layering** - Multiple defenses together are stronger than any single defense

---

## Print Instructions

1. Print on cardstock (250 gsm minimum)
2. Use a different color scheme from Defense Cards (suggest:
   - **RED background** with black text (indicates "attack" phase)
   - Compare to **BLUE background** for Defense Cards (indicates "defense" phase)
3. Cut along dotted lines
4. These should be shuffled and kept separate from Defense Cards during gameplay

---

## Expansion Possibilities

For advanced gameplay, additional Pentester Tactics could include:
- **PT-09:** Multi-Vector Attack (combines multiple tactics)
- **PT-10:** Zero-Day Exploitation (cannot be defeated by known defenses)
- **PT-11:** Ransomware Deployment (requires backup verification)
- **PT-12:** APT Campaign (multi-turn tactic with escalating difficulty)
- **PT-13:** Cloud-Specific Tactics (for cloud-native environments)
- **PT-14:** IoT/OT Compromise (for industrial environments)

See `expansion-deck/advanced-tactics.md` for these advanced cards.
