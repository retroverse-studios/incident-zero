## Event Mechanics

### Drawing Events

Each turn:
1. Resolve current turn's Crisis Actions
2. Draw next turn's Event Card
3. Read Event description
4. Apply Event consequences
5. Teams prepare response for next turn

### Event Escalation

Some events have escalation conditions:
- If not addressed, they get worse
- Example: First Media Coverage â†’ Media Frenzy
- Example: First breach â†’ Second Breach
- Prevention = addressing root cause quickly

### Event Combinations

Multiple events can occur:
- Turn 3: Board Meeting + First Regulatory Deadline (double pressure)
- Turn 4: Regulatory Fine + Customer Lawsuit (financial + legal)
- Turn 5: Second Breach + Executive Resignation (compounding crisis)

### Event Chaining

Events can trigger other events:
- Media Frenzy â†’ Shareholder Pressure (media coverage makes shareholders angry)
- Second Breach â†’ Competitor Advantage (another failure = lose more customers)
- Executive Resignation â†’ Second Breach (less supervision = attacker spreads)
