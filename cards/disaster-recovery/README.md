## How Cards Are Used

### Crisis Action Cards
1. **Chosen by Blue Team** - Select action each turn
2. **Cost Budget** - Each action has resource cost
3. **Advance Objectives** - Different actions advance different goals (investigation %, remediation %, trust %)
4. **Create Cascading Effects** - Poor choices make later turns harder

### Stakeholder Cards
1. **Represent Affected Parties** - Visible on board
2. **Track Satisfaction/Trust** - Each stakeholder has a status
3. **Create Escalation Points** - Unhappy stakeholders create additional pressure
4. **Determine Victory/Defeat** - Win if most stakeholders remain satisfied

### Event Cards
1. **Drawn Each Turn** - At start of turn, event card advances crisis
2. **Create Time Pressure** - Force decisions before team is ready
3. **Provide Information** - Some events reveal new breach details
4. **Trigger Escalations** - Major events increase stakeholder pressure

## Integration with Other Modules

### Incident Response → Disaster Recovery
- Use IR as lead-up to DR
- Assume IR was lost (attack succeeded)
- DR manages the breach response after detection failed

### Audit Findings → Disaster Recovery
- Audit findings create modifiers in DR
- Each failed audit domain adds Budget cost to DR actions
- Poor audit = DR becomes much more expensive

### Hardening → Disaster Recovery
- If hardening was successful, fewer critical systems are affected
- Speeds up recovery timeline
- Reduces escalation likelihood

### Network Building → Disaster Recovery
- Network design affects containment speed
- Well-segmented network = faster containment
- Flat network = cascading compromise
