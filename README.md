> A cooperative/competitive cybersecurity board game for educational environments

**Incident Zero** is a hands-on, engaging tabletop game that teaches cybersecurity concepts through gameplay. Players take on the roles of security professionals responding to cyberattacks, managing incident response, and building defensive strategies.

## Overview

Incident Zero combines strategic decision-making, resource management, and technical knowledge to create an immersive educational experience. Whether you're teaching incident response, security architecture, or crisis management, Incident Zero provides a flexible framework for multiple learning outcomes.

### What You'll Learn

- **Incident Response:** How to detect and investigate cyberattacks using the MITRE ATT&CK framework
- **Defense-in-Depth:** Building layered security controls to protect critical systems
- **Crisis Management:** Managing a breach response under pressure with stakeholder communication
- **Cyber Kill Chain:** Understanding attack progression from initial access to data exfiltration
- **Resource Prioritization:** Making security decisions under budget constraints
- **Real-World Threats:** Modern attack scenarios including supply chain, insider threats, IoT, and cloud-based attacks

## How It Works

### Core Gameplay

One player acts as the **Threat Orchestrator** (facilitator), while other players form **Blue Teams** (defenders). The Threat Orchestrator creates a hidden attack chain using Threat cards, and Blue Teams have a limited budget and turns to detect all cards in the chain through Investigation, Defense Deployment, or Emergency Response actions.

**Key Mechanics:**
- 1d20 roll-based investigation and defense actions
- Budget-constrained resource allocation
- Technical justification bonuses for strategic decisions
- Uncontained Threats penalties that escalate pressure
- Flexible, modular gameplay structure

### Game Modules: 6 Ways to Play

Incident Zero features **6 interchangeable modules** covering the complete cybersecurity incident lifecycle from planning through assessment:

**The 6 Core Modules (30-45 minutes each):**
1. **Network Building** - Design and secure network infrastructure
2. **Hardening** - Build layered defenses against known threats
3. **Incident Response** - Detect and investigate hidden attack chains
4. **Disaster Recovery** - Manage a breach crisis with stakeholder communication
5. **Forensics** - Investigate compromised systems and attribute attacks (NEW in v2.1)
6. **Audit & Compliance** - Conduct security assessments and compliance audits

**Recommended Combinations:**
- **Solo Play:** Any single module (30-45 min)
- **Detect & Investigate:** Incident Response → Forensics (90 min)
- **Crisis & Investigation:** Disaster Recovery → Forensics (90 min)
- **Detect & Defend:** Incident Response → Hardening (90 min)
- **Build, Test, Fix:** Network Building → Incident Response → Hardening (120 min)
- **Complete Lifecycle:** Network Building → Hardening → Incident Response → Disaster Recovery → Forensics → Audit (4-5 hours; split across sessions)

Each module can also be **generated procedurally** (dice rolls, cards) when played solo, so modules connect seamlessly in any educator-chosen sequence.

See [Module Combinations](docs/module-combinations.md) and [Gameplay Modes](docs/gameplay-modes.md) for detailed guidance on combining modules.

## Design Philosophy

**Incident Zero** is built on the principle that **security is a team sport**. By combining:
- Educational rigor (based on MITRE ATT&CK framework)
- Game mechanics (meaningful decisions, resource constraints)
- Real-world scenarios (from actual breach reports)

We create an environment where players learn by doing, make mistakes in a safe space, and develop intuition for security decision-making.

## What Makes This Game Unique

1. **Kill Chain Focus:** Players don't just detect threats; they understand the complete attack progression
2. **Justification Bonuses:** Success requires explaining *why* a decision matters, not just rolling dice
3. **Dual Outcomes:** Win against the attack → go to hardening; lose → manage the crisis
4. **Scalable Complexity:** From 3-card beginner chains to 5-card enterprise scenarios with expansion cards
5. **Modern Threats:** Includes supply chain, cloud, IoT, and insider threats alongside traditional attacks

## FAQ

**Q: How many players does this support?**
A: 2-6+ players. Best with 1 Threat Orchestrator and 2-4 Blue Team members (or multiple teams).

**Q: How long does a game take?**
A: 30-45 minutes for a mini-game, 90-120 minutes for a campaign.

**Q: Can we play this with no cybersecurity background?**
A: Yes! The game teaches concepts through play. New players start with beginner scenarios.

**Q: Can I create my own scenarios?**
A: Absolutely! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for scenario design guidelines.

**Q: What if we want to play competitively instead of cooperatively?**
A: The rules support both. See [Gameplay Modes](docs/gameplay-modes.md#competitive-mode) for competitive variants.

**Q: Can this be played online?**
A: The current version is tabletop-focused. A digital adaptation is a future possibility.

  - Accuracy pass: MITRE ATT&CK IDs, NIST CSF/CIS citations, GDPR/CCPA/ransom-legality facts corrected
  - New: Network Building standalone decks (REQ-01–20, EVT-01–16), tracker sheets, A4 print guide, playtest kit
  - Each module rules doc ends with a "v2.2 Playtest Edition Changes" section for playtesters

  - Added Uncontained Threats penalty mechanics
  - Balanced Fast-Track discovery reward
  - Introduced Pentester Tactic Cards for Phase 2
