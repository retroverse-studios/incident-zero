## Modifier Generation Procedures

When modules aren't combined sequentially, generate missing modifiers during setup:

### For Hardening Module (Solo or Mid-Sequence)

**Generate Attack Vectors via Scenario Card:**
- Draw 4 cards from scenario deck
- Each card describes a threat vector and difficulty
- Players must defend against all 4 vectors

**Or Generate via Dice:**
- Roll 4d6 for each vector type
- Result determines threat sophistication (3=easy, 6=hardest)
- Adjust defense difficulty accordingly

### For Disaster Recovery Module (Solo or Mid-Sequence)

**Generate Breach Scope via Dice:**
- Roll 2d6: [3-5] = Low (50K records), [6-8] = Medium (500K), [9-12] = High (5M+)
- Generate breach timeline: Roll 1d4 = hours before discovery (1=6h, 2=12h, 3=24h, 4=48h)
- Set ransom demand: d20 × $50K

**Or Use Scenario Card:**
- Educator describes breach scenario (real or fictional)
- Players respond to described incident

### For Incident Response Module (Solo)

**Generate Attack Chain via Threat Cards:**
- Shuffle threat card deck
- Draw 3, 4, or 5 cards (by difficulty)
- Arrange in logical attack progression
- Create clues for Threat Orchestrator

**Or Use Pre-Built Scenario:**
- Use sample scenarios from core rules
- Customize threat vectors based on learning objectives

### For Network Building Module (Solo)

**Generate Requirements via Requirement Card:**
- Draw cards specifying assets: "Email Server, Customer Database, Development Network"
- Draw security requirements: "MFA required, Data encryption mandatory, Audit logging"
- Players design network meeting all constraints

### For Audit & Compliance Module (Solo)

**Generate Audit Scope via Dice:**
- Roll 1d4: [1] = Financial compliance, [2] = Data protection, [3] = Incident response, [4] = Mixed
- Roll 1d3: [1] = 3 findings needed, [2] = 5 findings, [3] = 7 findings
- Determine which findings player must identify during audit

## Educator Tips

### For Time-Constrained Sessions
- Single module is fastest (30-45 min, all inclusive)
- Choose module matching learning objective
- Pre-generate modifiers before class

### For Multiple Class Sessions
- **Session 1:** Single module (Incident Response solo = 45 min)
- **Session 2:** Build on it (IR + Hardening = 90 min)
- **Session 3:** Add more modules as students understand system

### For Competitive Tournaments
- Single module tournament is simplest (all same rules)
- Multi-module tournament is more engaging (different tracks)
- Assign split bracket based on Phase 1 outcomes

### For Maximum Engagement
- Allow student choice in module combinations
- Create scenario cards matching real-world events
- Encourage custom debrief questions
