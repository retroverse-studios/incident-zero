# Card Consistency Model & Field Structure

**Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Document which card fields are universal, which are module-specific, and which are unique to card types

---

## Overview

Incident Zero uses a **hierarchical consistency model** with three levels:

1. **Universal Core Fields** - Appear on ALL cards across ALL modules
2. **Module-Specific Fields** - Appear only in certain modules (but consistent within that module)
3. **Card Type Unique Fields** - Appear only on specific card types

This document maps every field to its consistency level.

---

# Part 1: Universal Core Fields

These fields appear on **EVERY card** in **EVERY module**:

| Field | Description | Location | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Card ID** | Unique identifier | Top right badge | T-01, D-24, PT-09, A-01, E-12, SRV-03, DOM-02 |
| **Card Type** | Type of card | Top left | THREAT CARD, DEFENSE CARD, EVENT CARD, etc. |
| **Title** | Card name | Prominent | PHISHING CAMPAIGN, EMAIL AUTHENTICATION SETUP |
| **Description/Narrative** | What is this? | Center | Scenario, explanation, or narrative text |
| **Optional Image Space** | 2"×2" artwork area | Center/middle | [PICTURE HERE] |
| **Keywords/Tags** | Searchable terms | Bottom | phishing \| email \| credential harvesting |

# Part 2: Module-Specific Field Sets

# Part 4: Consistency in Practice

## Example: How Fields Progress Across Modules

Let's track **Email Security** across all modules to show field consistency:

### Network Building (Design Phase)
```
SRV-01: EMAIL SERVER
├─ Cost: 8 Budget (when designing)
├─ Complexity: 2/4
├─ Availability: 99.9%
├─ Criticality: ★★★★★
└─ Required Defenses: Email Auth, Gateway, MFA
```

### Incident Response (Attack Phase)
```
T-01: PHISHING CAMPAIGN
├─ Vector: SOCIAL_ENGINEERING (targets email users)
├─ DC: 12 (difficulty to detect)
├─ Counters: D-01 (Email Auth), D-02 (Training), D-03 (Gateway)
```

### Hardening (Testing Phase)
```
PT-01: SOCIAL ENGINEERING - PRETEXTING
├─ Targets: Email helpdesk processes
├─ DC: 12 (defeat)
├─ Defending: D-02 (+2), D-07 (+1) — same defenses reused
```

### Disaster Recovery (Crisis Phase)
```
EVENT-01: FIRST MEDIA COVERAGE
└─ Mitigated by: ACTION-11 (Media Management)

ACTION-01: FORENSIC ANALYSIS
├─ May discover: Email compromise, credential theft
└─ Duration: 2 turns (to analyze email logs)
```

### Audit & Compliance (Assessment Phase)
```
DOMAIN-02: ACCESS CONTROL & IDENTITY
├─ Assesses: Email MFA, credential policies
├─ Finding: "No MFA on email access"
└─ Remediation: REMEDIATION-01 (MFA deployment)
```

**Note:** Same email server appears across all modules, with different fields relevant to each module's purpose, but with consistent references.

---

# Part 5: Design Principles for Consistency

## ✅ DO: Maintain Field Consistency

1. **Universal Fields:** Always include Card ID, Type, Title, Description, Keywords
2. **Vector System:** Use same attack vectors across IR and Hardening
3. **Cost/Difficulty:** Use consistent scales (Budget 10/15/25, DC 12-16)
4. **Cross-References:** Link cards between modules (T-01 references D-01, SRV-01 references T-01)
5. **Maturity Scales:** 1-5 stars for assessments, difficulty tiers for challenges

## ❌ DON'T: Break the Pattern

1. ❌ Create fields that only appear on one card
2. ❌ Use different cost scales in different modules (except where intentional)
3. ❌ Fail to cross-reference related cards
4. ❌ Introduce new field names for existing concepts
5. ❌ Use different vector names for same attacks

## 🎯 Best Practice: Extend Not Replace

When adding module-specific fields:
- **Keep universal fields intact**
- **Add new fields after core fields**
- **Follow existing naming conventions**
- **Document the new field** in this consistency model
- **Ensure cross-module references** work

---

# Part 6: Field Naming Conventions

Use these standard field names across all cards:

### Metadata Fields
- `Card Type` - THREAT CARD, DEFENSE CARD, etc.
- `Card ID` - T-01, D-24, etc.
- `Title` - Card name

### Common Assessment Fields
- `Cost` - Budget requirement
- `Difficulty` / `DC` - Challenge rating
- `Vector` / `Vectors` - Attack/Defense category
- `Type` - Category within module
- `Tier` - Tier level
- `Duration` - Time required
- `Complexity` - Difficulty of implementation

### Common Effect Fields
- `Effect` - What this card does
- `Impact` - Consequences or changes
- `Advancement` - Progress metric
- `Scoring` / `Rating` - Effectiveness (⭐)

### Common Relationship Fields
- `Synergies` - Works well with
- `Used Against` / `Defends Against` - Counters
- `Interactions` - Cross-module references
- `Related Cards` / `Cross-References` - Other relevant cards

### Common Outcome Fields
- `Outcome` / `Outcomes` - SUCCESS/FAILURE
- `Escalation` / `Escalation Path` - What happens next
- `Remediation` - How to fix

---

# Part 7: Creating New Cards with Consistency

## Checklist for New Card Fields

When creating a new card:

- [ ] **Use existing universal fields** (ID, Type, Title, Description, Keywords)
- [ ] **Check module field patterns** - Follow existing cards in that module
- [ ] **Don't invent new fields** - Use existing field names
- [ ] **Cross-reference other cards** - Link to related cards in same/other modules
- [ ] **Document exceptions** - If you must add a truly unique field, explain why
- [ ] **Test consistency** - Does this card feel like it belongs with existing cards?
- [ ] **Verify naming** - Are field names consistent with existing cards?
- [ ] **Check references** - Do cross-references work both ways?

## Answer to Your Question

**Are cards consistent?**

**YES**, with a three-tier hierarchy:

1. **Universal Core** (6 fields on every card)
   - Card ID, Type, Title, Description, Image Space, Keywords

2. **Module-Specific** (consistent within each module)
   - Incident Response: Vector, DC, Tier, Cost system
   - Hardening: Tactic Type, Threat Level, Teaching Point
   - Disaster Recovery: Category, Duration, Stakeholder Impact
   - Network Building: Type, Complexity, Availability, Criticality
   - Audit & Compliance: Focus, Maturity Levels, Remediation

3. **Card Type Unique** (specific to card type, not module)
   - Some card types have 4-6 unique fields
   - Example: Event Cards have Escalation Paths (unique to events)
   - Example: Crisis Actions have Stakeholder Impact (unique to DR actions)

**There is NOT a single "Unique Element" field that updates per module.** Instead, **different card types have different numbers of unique fields**, and **modules are defined by which card types they use** + **those card types' unique fields.**

For example:
- **Threat Cards have 4 unique fields** (Step, Vector, DC, Counters)
- **Event Cards have 6 unique fields** (Type, Turn, Trigger, Severity, Escalation, Duration)
- **Pentester Tactics have 6 unique fields** (Tactic Type, Threat Level, Attack Details, Defending Defenses, Outcome, Teaching Point)

This is more flexible than a single "Unique" field because different card types genuinely need different information.
